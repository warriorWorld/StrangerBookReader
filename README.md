# StrangerBookReader
This is a book reader

You could download it [here](https://github.com/warriorWorld/StrangerBookReader/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk "Android apk 安装包")

I developed this app for me to learn English(again) by you know, reading books. It supports TXT and PDF.

##### Technical detail(if you are not interested, just ignore this part)
I write a view that can show texts on it, and when users click on a single word, I would get the letter by the coordinate position, and then I would use a regular expression to group a word, and finally, I would translate it and show it to users.
